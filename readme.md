# Webster Website

This project is a company website that aims to provide complete and engaging information for customers. By combining captivating animation and design, the website is designed to provide a fun and easy experience for users to access information about the company, products, and services offered.

In developing this project, we used React and NodeJS technologies with a client-server architecture that allows the website to be accessed by users from various devices and locations. The use of React technology allows us to build a dynamic and responsive website interface, while NodeJS is used to manage server logic and provide the data needed by the application.

This website is expected to help companies expand their market reach and improve interaction with customers. Through engaging visuals and interactive animations, the website provides a fun and easy experience for users to access information about the company, products, and services offered.
